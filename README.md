# Decode Morse Code

## Problem

> During your vacation at the seaside, time after time you find old bottles with parchment inside. Out of curiosity, you look into the next bottle and see that there is a message written in Morse code. Your curiosity grows even more - maybe you just found the lost treasure of the pirates! However, you are getting tired of decrypting messages manually. Fortunately, you can program in Ruby and you can help yourself by automating this process.

## Project Features

- Decodes a Morse code character, takes a string parameter, and return the corresponding character in uppercase (e.g. decode_char(".-") returns "A").
  -Decodes an entire word in Morse code, takes a string parameter, and return the string representation. Every character in a word will be separated by a single space (e.g. decode_word("-- -.--") returns "MY").
- decode the entire message in Morse code, takes a string parameter, and return the string representation. Every word will be separated by 3 spaces (e.g.

```ruby
decode("-- -.--   -. .- -- .")
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; returns **_"My Name"_**
and

```ruby
decode(".-   -... --- -..-   ..-. ..- .-.. .-..   --- ..-. / .-. ..- -... .. . ...")
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; returns the decoded message from the old bottle
